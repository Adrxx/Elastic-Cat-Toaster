 **Thank you for using my playground!**
 
 I now say goodbye with this piece, this doesn't have any variants and is not as "wallpapery" as the last two, but I made it to show a visual representation of software randomness. This two particles have chaotic movements, both will always mimic each other because they have the same seed. You wanna know the seed That I used?

let seed = "WWDC 2018"
/*:
 And it's the same seed that made me create this playground.

 So I call this piece **The Pulse of Randomness**, going on forever and ever...
 just like my passion for software and technology ‚ù§Ô∏è.
 
 I really had a lot of fun building all of this and I hope you had fun experiencing it.
 Feel free to use any art piece as your wallpaper if you want üòâ. And now, a poem...
 
 *Roses are red...*
 
 *Violets are blue...*
 
 *I'm no good at rhymes...*
 
 *Toaster!*
